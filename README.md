## Usage
To initiate the trading robot, use the `OnTick()` function. This function performs the following steps:
1. Identifies 'Double Tops' and 'Double Bottoms' patterns using the `DetectDoubleTops()` function.
2. Generates real-time signals using the `GenerateSignal()` function if a pattern is detected.
3. Optimizes gain rates by predicting the next reversal move using the `OptimizeGainRates()` function.
4. Executes trades based on the generated signals using the `ExecuteTrades()` function.

## Code Structure
```cpp
// Main function to initiate the trading robot
void OnTick()
{
    // Identify 'Double Tops' and 'Double Bottoms' patterns
    if (DetectDoubleTops())
    {
        // Generate real-time signal
        GenerateSignal();
    }
    
    // Optimize gain rates by predicting the next reversal move
    OptimizeGainRates();
    
    // Execute trades based on generated signals
    ExecuteTrades();
}

// Function to detect 'Double Tops' and 'Double Bottoms' patterns
bool DetectDoubleTops()
{
    // Implementation of 'Double Tops' and 'Double Bottoms' detection logic
    // ...
    
    return true; // If pattern is detected
}

// Function to generate real-time signal
void GenerateSignal()
{
    // Implementation of real-time signal generation logic
    // ...
}

// Function to optimize gain rates by predicting the next reversal move
void OptimizeGainRates()
{
    // Implementation of gain rate optimization logic
    // ...
}

// Function to execute trades based on generated signals
void ExecuteTrades()
{
    // Implementation of trade execution logic
    // ...
}
